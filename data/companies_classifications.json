RPO is specifically designed to reduce risk, turnover, and recruitment cost.Consider this; academic research shows that compared with other forms of evaluating candidates, structured interviews with one person interviewing and one person observing yield the highest level of validity and reliability. Yet most organisations lack the expertise to properly structure and conduct interviews or consider that a lack of cultural fit is often cited as the reason for an unsuccessful appointment.So, let\u2019s unpack that, what does \u201cfit\u201d mean and how do you assess it? What is the predictive ability of personality tests? How well does your recruitment agency spend getting to know you and the way that you work? How do you really get to know what a candidate is like? As a Fjord RPO client, you\u2019ll get answers to these questions backed up by research and data. You\u2019ll also get a dedicated skilled professional who will participate fully in your talent agenda.In serving several clients, Fjord can spread the cost of running a technologically adept, highly skilled recruitment team across a greater volume of activity than your business alone might typically require. The concept is that you get a highly skilled team for less cost than you might otherwise incur.Our service will be delivered to you by a dedicated Fjord professional, supported by the entire Fjord team. The objective of the Fjord Professional is to get to know you, your company and your business as well as you do yourselves.

Using proprietary or external video feed from the games, Kognia\u2019s technology automatizes and conducts real-time and post-match tactical analysis of football games.Kognia\u2019s software provides feedback directly to coaching staffs in their own language. Coaches are alerted to important tactical situations and given suggestions for exploiting them. Post-match, users can review squad performance and explore a database of training drills based on the detected tactics.Current methods of data analysis have limited practical application for coaches (e.g., surface-level statistics such as heat maps and distance traveled), and despite technology, a coaching staff must still spend many hours doing manual video analysis in order to identify tactical patterns. Kognia\u2019s approach differs from current alternatives because it detects specific, high-level tactical fundamentals that have our team of football experts led by Joan Vil\u00e0, former FC Barcelona Director of Methodology and mentor to numerous elite players and coaches such as Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez and Carles Puyol.The vision of Kognia goes beyond serving technical staff in Football Clubs.

There is a lack of business support for creators, making the process of creator development inaccessible and extremely difficult.

POP\u2019s platform equips clients with real time oversight, actionable data insight and optimised workflows to proactively manage all of the people, across all of their productions. Each portal provides a secure and streamlined process for production companies, their productions, crew, casting directors and background artists; revolutionising the way people in production are found, hired, managed and paid.\u00a0In 2019 some portion of POP tech powered over 60% of all UK HETV production including Killing Eve, 1917 and The Crown, revolutionising the way people in production are found, hired, managed and paid.POP\u2019S STORYWe Got POP was founded by Kate McLaughlin in 2014 with a vision of a smarter, fairer future for entertainment. With headquarters in London and New York, POP is the industry\u2019s leading technology innovator, building technology to digitise production processes; connect the industry and open access to opportunity and insight.\u00a0POP launched in 2014 with its first product. The Casting Portal has revolutionised background casting by making the casting process more efficient, transparent and secure, facilitating the next generation of casting talent to transform the way they work. By 2019 over 60% of all extras casting in the UK was powered by POP technology including The Crown, 1917 and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. POP successfully launched into the US in 2018 and is currently being rolled out across Central Casting, the leading background casting company in the US, casting thousands of roles everyday, now powering the majority of the market in the UK & US, POP is the most widely used casting technology in the world.\u00a0With the Casting Portal well established POP expanded focus to meet the needs of production companies. POP\u2019s next game changing technology, the Production Portal provides a standardised and secure framework for production companies to manage all of their people across all of their shows, providing access to real time oversight, insight and confidence in compliance. Launched in 2019 the uptake has been phenomenal; POP now has 25+ of the UK\u2019s leading production companies running all of their shows through POP including the creators of Killing Eve, Peaky Blinders and Call the Midwife, and this is growing monthly.In line with POP\u2019s commitment to drive change in the industry they soft launched their latest product, the Crew Portal in 2020, which gives crew access to the best job opportunities, industry insight and the ability to grow their network. Already POP have helped talented crew land roles on some of 2020\u2019s biggest releases, including Gangs of London, Dracula and several major feature films. During lockdown POP launched virtual networking for crew to speed meet and greet hirers outside of their network in a time efficient and safe way. Within a few weeks this model has made an impact and is set to be adopted by major TV shows to help them hire a diverse crew, beyond their current network.\u00a0POP is set apart by their approach; industry partnership and meaningful collaboration which ensures the technology meets the industry\u2019s needs today, and keeps abreast of their future needs. This partnered approach has seen POP become a force for change in the industry with the industry frequently turning to POP for solutions to wider industry challenges. This approach saw POP use production\u2019s down time as a result of COVID-19 to refine their response and partner with clients to create a solution to a new need for a \u2018fit to work\u2019 check and alert system. With the added \u2018fit to work\u2019 check and alert feature the Production Portal is the one touch free, cloud based solution production companies need to get their production teams safely back on set. Entertainment\u2019s need for cloud based technology has never been stronger; the Production Portal is powering over 50% of UK\u2019s HETV restarting productions post COVID-19 and is in conversations with many new production companies now exploring cloud based tech.\u00a0Starting with a co-founder and a vision for a smarter, fairer future for entertainment Kate has built a team of 54 (including a 75% female senior leadership team) to create an industry disrupting and leading business, revolutionising the UK film & TV industry and taking major strides to replicate this success in the US and beyond.\u00a0\u00a0POP raised \u00a34m in investment from Octopus Ventures, Pinewood Studios and others before finding a partner in industry giants, Entertainment Partners who acquired POP in March 2020 to partner in a shared mission to be the production partner in entertainment\u2019s journey to a smarter, fairer future.\u00a0Ashok Dudhat",
